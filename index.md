# About me
Currently, I am the Interim Training Director at the [Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology (CSDE)](https://csde.washington.edu/). My roles include support and training for graduate students at CSDE as they pursue demographic and population research, statistical and demographic methods consulting, and developing new forums for scientific communitication of demographic research within research communities and also with the public.

I recently received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington. I was a fellow of and received training in demographic methods from CSDE. My dissertation was advised by [Jon Wakefield](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/). My broad research interests include demography, Bayesian spatiotemporal methods, survey statistics, and the places where all of those things overlap.

Born and raised in Alabama, I received my M.S. in Statistics at Auburn University. My thesis, titled "Group lasso for functional logistic regression", was advised by [Nedret Billor](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~billone/). I also received a B.S. in Actuarial Science and a minor in tailgating from the loveliest village on the plains. War eagle!!!  <img src="./AU.jpg" width="22">

# What am I working on now?

## Applied Research Fellowship Program: Summer 2021

I was the Project Lead for the 2021 cohort of the [Applied Research Fellowship Program](https://www.washington.edu/populationhealth/education-and-training/applied-research-fellowship/) supported by the University of Washington's [Population Health Initiative](https://www.washington.edu/populationhealth/) in partnership with [CSDE](https://csde.washington.edu/). Along with a team of three graduate student fellows and two undergraduate student fellows, we used American Community Survey data to estimate changes in the distribution of households within King County by household size, renter or owner status, and family status to better understand the varied types of households and their housing needs. Through expert interviews and use of King County assessor data, we also identify housing vulnerabilities and how they vary by owner or renter status in the face of disaster events such as flooding, earthquakes, and extreme heat. The results of our work this summer will be publicly available soon!

## Dissertation

My thesis, "Spatiotemporal estimation of period child mortality in a low and middle income countries context", focuses on statistical and demographic methods to improve subnational estimation of child mortality in countries that rely on complex household surveys to provide comprehensive demographic and health information about the population.  Specifically, it addresses the following three questions:

1. How can estimates of period child mortality vary across demographic definitions and statistical methods of estimation when using full birth histories from complex household surveys?
   - Manuscript in progress.
3. Can we combine both design-based direct full birth histories from complex surveys with summary birth histories from censuses and surveys in a discrete space-time smoothing model to make estimates of child mortality at the Admin-2 level?

3. Can we use model-based methods to estimate child mortality at the Admin-2 level from full birth histories when design-based estimation fails in sparser data settings?
