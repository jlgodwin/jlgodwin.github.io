## About me
I am a Ph.D Candidate in the Department of Statistics and a Fellow of the Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology at the University of Washington. My broad research interests include statistical demography, spatiotemporal methods, mortality, and spatial health inequalities. For more information, see my [CV](./CV.pdf).

My dissertation, titled "Estimating Mortality at the Subnational Level in a Low and Middle Income Countries Context", focuses on Bayesian spatiotemporal models for child mortality and is supervised by [Jon Wakefield](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/). Specifically, it addresses the following three questions:
* Can we make subnational estimates of under-five mortality at the Admin-2 level using both complex household surveys and census data?
* Can we make subnational estimates of child mortality for ages 5-10 and 10-15 using complex household surveys?
* Does the association between known proximate and social determinants of child mortality vary across ages (neonatal, post-neonatal, child) and across space within sub-Saharan Africa?

Born and raised in Alabama, I received my M.S. in Statistics at Auburn University. My thesis, titled "Group lasso for functional logistic regression", was advised by [Nedret Billor](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~billone/). I received a B.S. in Actuarial Science from Auburn University as well. War eagle!!!  <img src="./AU.jpg" width="22">
