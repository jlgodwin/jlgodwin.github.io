# About me
Currently, I am a Statistical Demographer and the Training Director at the [Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology (CSDE)](https://csde.washington.edu/). My roles include support and training for CSDE students pursuing demographic and population research and providing consulting in statistical and demographic methods to CSDE faculty affiliates and students.  I am passionate about teaching, mentorship, and research applications that improve the lives of people and communities.

I recently received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington. In addition, I was a CSDE T32 Fellow and completed my training in demographic methods. My dissertation titled "Spatiotemporal estimation of period child mortality in a low and middle income countries context" was advised by [Dr. Jon Wakefield (chair)](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/), [Dr. Emilio Zagheni](https://www.zagheni.net/index.html), [Dr. Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/), and [Dr. Mark Ellis](https://geography.washington.edu/people/mark-ellis). My broad research interests include **demographic methods, Bayesian spatiotemporal methods, survey statistics,** and the places where all of those things overlap.

Born and raised in Alabama, I received my M.S. in Statistics at Auburn University. My thesis, titled "Group lasso for functional logistic regression", was advised by [Dr. Nedret Billor](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~billone/). I also received a B.S. in Actuarial Science and a minor in tailgating from the loveliest village on the plains. War eagle!!!  <img src="./AU.jpg" width="22">
