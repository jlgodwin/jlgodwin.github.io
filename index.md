# About me
Currently, I am a Statistical Demographer and the Training Director at the [Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology (CSDE)](https://csde.washington.edu/). My roles include support and training for CSDE students pursuing demographic and population research and providing consulting in statistical and demographic methods to CSDE faculty affiliates and students.  I am passionate about teaching, mentorship, and research applications that improve the lives of people and communities

I recently received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington. In addition, I was a CSDE T32 Fellow and completed my training in demographic methods. My dissertation titled "Spatiotemporal estimation of period child mortality in a low and middle income countries context" was advised by [Dr. Jon Wakefield (chair)](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/), [Dr. Emilio Zagheni](https://www.zagheni.net/index.html), [Dr. Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/), and [Dr. Mark Ellis](https://geography.washington.edu/people/mark-ellis). My broad research interests include **demographic methods, Bayesian spatiotemporal methods, survey statistics,** and the places where all of those things overlap.

Born and raised in Alabama, I received my M.S. in Statistics at Auburn University. My thesis, titled "Group lasso for functional logistic regression", was advised by [Dr. Nedret Billor](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~billone/). I also received a B.S. in Actuarial Science and a minor in tailgating from the loveliest village on the plains. War eagle!!!  <img src="./AU.jpg" width="22">

# What am I working on now?

## Research Projects

  *  **Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity in the U.S.:** Working with Dr. [Steven M. Goodreau](https://anthropology.washington.edu/people/steven-m-goodreau) (Anthropology, UW) and [Mike P. Barry](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lcnqaEsAAAAJ&hl=en) (Epidemiology, UW) along with other collaborators at UW and the CDC to examine recent trends in the U.S. prevalence of sexual and gender minorities along the age, period, and cohort dimensions using YRBS and BRFSS data. Work supported by CDC grant U38-PS004646.
  *  **Excess Mortality in Puerto Rico following Hurricane María:** Work with Drs. [Sameer Shah](https://sefs.uw.edu/research/faculty-profile/sameer-shah/) (School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, UW) and [Mary Angelica Painter](https://hazards.colorado.edu/biography/mary-angelica-painter) (Natural Hazards Center, University of Colorado Boulder) to estimate the excess mortality in Puerto Rico following Hurricane María on a finer age- and spatial-scale than previous work.
  *  **Synthesizing Local Housing Data to Compare to the Census Bureau:** Work with Diana Canzoneri (Demographer, City of Seattle), Jennifer Pettyjohn (GIS Specialist, City of Seattle), and [Ron Prevost](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prevost-ronald-b674032b/) (Consultant, Demographic Analytics Advisors) to identify discrepancies between the Census Bureau's housing units data and local sources such as the King County Assessments tax parcel data and the City of Seattle's building permits. We aim to understand and rectify these discrepancies ahead of the 2030 Census.


## Applied Research Fellowship Program: Summer 2024

I am the Project Lead for the [Applied Research Fellowship Program](https://www.washington.edu/populationhealth/education-and-training/applied-research-fellowship/) supported by the University of Washington's [Population Health Initiative](https://www.washington.edu/populationhealth/) in partnership with [CSDE](https://csde.washington.edu/). This summer, along with a team of three graduate and two undergraduate student fellows, we used Data Axle's annual business data to assess trends in the local business landscape in King County, Washington. We assessed the accuracy of Data Axle's information on local businesses through comparisons with the Census Bureau's County Business Patterns and other local government reports. We summarized the total number of employers by employee size as well as the Top 10 employers for King County as a whole and for its Health Reporting Areas (HRAs).  We also looked specifically trends in the presence of pharmacies, grocery stores, child care facilities, and third places by HRA. Please see [our report](https://jlgodwin.github.io/Research/ARFP%202024%20Report%20Draft.pdf) written for King County stakeholders for more details.
