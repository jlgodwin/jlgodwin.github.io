## About me
I am a Ph.D candidate at the University of Washington in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/), a fellow of the [Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology](https://csde.washington.edu/), and briefly a visiting member of the Lab of [Digital and Compuational Demography](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/research_6120/digital_and_computational_demography_5555) at that Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. My broad research interests include demography, Bayesian spatiotemporal methods, survey statistics, and the places where all of those things overlap. For more information, see my [CV](./CV.pdf).

My dissertation, "Spatiotemporal Estimation of Period Child Mortality in a Low and Middle Income Countries Context", focuses on Bayesian spatiotemporal methods for child mortality in countries that rely on household survey data to estimate demographic indicators and is supervised by [Jon Wakefield](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/). Specifically, it addresses the following three questions:

  * How can estimates of period child mortality vary across demographic definitions and statistical methods of estimation when using full birth histories from complex household surveys?
  * Can we combine both design-based direct full birth histories from complex surveys with summary birth histories from censuses and surveys in a discrete space-time smoothing model to make estimates of child mortality at the Admin-2 level?

  * Can we use model-based methods to estimate child mortality at the Admin-2 level from full birth histories when design-based estimation fails in sparser data settings?

Born and raised in Alabama, I received my M.S. in Statistics at Auburn University. My thesis, titled "Group lasso for functional logistic regression", was advised by [Nedret Billor](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~billone/). I received a B.S. in Actuarial Science and tailgating from Auburn University as well. War eagle!!!  <img src="./AU.jpg" width="22">
